--[[
A tagging system for multiple taglists
tags are arranged in a table such that each screen has it's own tagsets and each tagset has its own awfu.widget.taglist



internally, tags are represented like this:
elements={
    screen[1]={
        id=1
        lpanel=z.lpanel(...)
        tagset[#n_i]={
            wibox_layout=wibox.layout...
            label="ts1"
            widget_background=
            textbox=
            tag[#n_j]={
                id=#id --We don't seem to need this
                label="tag1"
                rules={}
                widget_background=wibox.widget.background()
                textbox=wibox.widget.textbox
                icon=wibox.widget.imagebox
                buttons=awful.util.table.join(...)
                awful_tag=awful.tag(...) --awful tag associated with this it.tag
                default_client_layout=awful.layout.suit...
                
            }
        }
    }
    screen[2]={...}
}

externally, tagsets can be created in several ways, the easiest of which is:
screen=z.screen(
    tagsets={ {"tag1","tag2"}, {"tag3","tag4"} }
)
This uses some default values to construct the internal representation of the tagsets
alternatively, a more complex result can be achieved by passing the internal representation of the tagsets:

screen=z.screen(args={
    id=#
    lpanel=
    tagset[1]={...},
    tagset[2]={...},
})

notes:

I have to pass through the screen.id to z.it.screen->z.it.tagset->z.it.tag since awsome.tag requires a screen number :( ugly! the alternative is to have screen field in z.it.tag, but i like that less for the time being
