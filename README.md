#Another configuration framework for the awesome window manager
Implementing a sets of tags (see ./z/it), client management, confgurable client to tag mechanism, organising clients and much more. Using the core awesome and awful implementation of tagging.

This configuration is aiming at seemlessly managing large number of applications and long lived work sessions.
It can be used for convinient development environment for a full development stack as it organises opened project and applications into multiple tags in multiple tagsets, which are renameable and highly configurable. it works well with penetration testing sessions and other complex and otherwise messy desktop environments.

It utilizes z.panel and z.lpanel (see ./z/[l]panel.lua and ./z/utils.lua) wibox panel lists and menus.
This configuration was tested on awesome "v3.5.9 (Mighty Ravendark)" and lua 5.1.5
See rc.lua for hints on how to implement your personalised modifications.
